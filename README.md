# Arduino Menu UI

An [Arduino](https://arduino.cc/) library which provides a menu based user interface and a few utilities.

Really elastic, just instantiate menu options and add it to a screen, and add the screens to the menu system.

## Compatible Hardware

Tested on ATMega328p(Arduino nano) and RP2040(Raspberry pi pico)

**NOTES**:
 * Be aware of captions text(char *) length, must be less than menuTextArrayLength(menu.h), might corrupt memory!
 * YOU must learn Object Oriented Programming, and inheritance, or just copy examples
